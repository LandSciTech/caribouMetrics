\title{caribouMetrics: Models and metrics of boreal caribou responses to forest
landscapes}
\description{
The caribouMetrics package provides implementations of several different
models for boreal caribou. These include the resource selection probability
functions (RSPF) described in [Hornseth and Rempel
(2016)](https://doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2015-0101) and the disturbance metrics
described in Table 52 of Environment Canada Scientific Assessment to Inform
the Identification of Critical Habitat for Woodland Caribou (\emph{Rangifer
tarandus caribou}), Boreal Population, in Canada 2011 Update.

\title{caribouMetrics: Models and metrics of boreal caribou responses to forest
landscapes}
\description{
The caribouMetrics R package provides reproducible open source
implementations of several models of Boreal woodland caribou (\emph{Rangifer
tarandus caribou}) demography and habitat use. A national two-stage demographic model with
density dependence and interannual variability follows \href{doi:10.1111/1365-2664.13637}{Johnson et. al. (2020)} with modifications described in \href{https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.01.494350}{Dyson et al. (2022)}. Demographic
rates vary with disturbance as estimated by \href{doi:10.1111/1365-2664.13637}{Johnson et. al. (2020)}. The package also includes a Bayesian population model
designed to integrate prior information from Johnson et al's national analysis of demographic-disturbance
relationships with available local demographic data to reduce uncertainty in population viability projections.
The Bayesian population model is an extension of work by
\href{https://doi.org/10.1002/wsb.950}{Eacker et al. (2019)}. The national model can be used to simulate
example population trajectories, and combined with a simple observation model and the Bayesian population model
to show how monitoring requirements depend on landscape condition. Finally,
caribouMetrics contains a set of functions which implement \href{https://doi.org/10.1139/cjz-2015-0101}{Hornseth and Rempel's (2016)} Ontario boreal caribou resource selection model
as described in  for Ontario boreal caribou
ranges described in \href{https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.06.01.494350}{Dyson et al. (2022)}. Model implementation
is intended to be modular and flexible, allowing reuse of components in a variety of contexts including
projections of the cumulative effects of disturbance and climate change \href{https://doi.org/10.1002/eap.2816}{(e.g. Stewart et al. 2023)}
and a \href{https://landscitech.github.io/BayesianCaribouDemographicProjection/}{Shiny app} designed to allow allow exploration of user-specified monitoring and disturbance scenarios.

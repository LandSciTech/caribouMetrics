\title{Get coefficients for model version}
\usage{
getCoefs(populationGrowthTable, resVar, modVer, modNum)
}
\arguments{
\item{populationGrowthTable}{data.frame. \code{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC} is
included in the package and should be used in most cases. A custom table of
model parameters can be provided but it must match the column names of
\code{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC}.}

\item{resVar}{character. Response variable, typically "femaleSurvival" or
"recruitment"}

\item{modVer}{character vector. Which model version(s) to use. Options are
typically "ECCC" for the model used in the ECCC Report (2011) and "Johnson"
for the model used in Johnson et. al. (2020)}

\item{modNum}{character vector. Which model number(s) to use see
\code{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC$ModelNumber} for typical options.}
}
\value{
a named list with one element per model version. The names are
  \code{modVer}_\code{modNum}_Type. Each element contains a data.frame that
  is a subset of \code{populationGrowthTable} for the selected model
}
\description{
Get the coefficients for the chosen model version(s), number(s) and response
variable from a table of coefficients for many models. If the table does not
contain the standard error it is calculated from the confidence interval.

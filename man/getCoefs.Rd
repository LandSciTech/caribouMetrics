\title{Get coefficients for model version}
\usage{
getCoefs(populationGrowthTable, resVar, modVer, modNum)
}
\arguments{
\item{populationGrowthTable}{data.frame. \code{\link{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC}} is
included in the package and should be used in most cases. A custom table of
model parameters can be provided but it must match the column names of
\code{\link{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC}}.}

\item{resVar}{character. Response variable, typically "femaleSurvival" or
"recruitment"}

\item{modVer}{character vector. Which model version(s) to use. Currently the
only option is "Johnson" for the model used in Johnson et. al. (2020), but
additional options may be added in the future.}

\item{modNum}{character vector. Which model number(s) to use see
\code{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC$ModelNumber} for typical options.}
}
\value{
a named list with one element per model version. The names are
\code{modVer_modNum_Type}. Each element contains a data.frame that
is a subset of \code{populationGrowthTable} for the selected model
}
\description{
Get the coefficients for the chosen model version(s), number(s) and response
variable from a table of coefficients for many models. If the table does not
contain the standard error it is calculated from the confidence interval.

\examples{
getCoefs(popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC, "femaleSurvival", "Johnson", "M1")

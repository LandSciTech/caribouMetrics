simulateObservations(
  cs,
  cowCounts,
  freqStartsByYear,
  printPlot = FALSE,
  collarNumYears = 4,
  collarOffTime = 5,
  collarOnTime = 8,

}
\arguments{
\item{cs}{list. Parameters for the simulations. See \code{\link[=getScenarioDefaults]{getScenarioDefaults()}} for
details.}

\item{cowCounts}{data.frame. Number of cows counted in aerial surveys each
year. Must have 3 columns "Year", "Count", and "Class" where class is "cow"
in all rows}

\item{freqStartsByYear}{data.frame. Number of collars deployed in each year.
Must have 2 columns "Year" and "numStarts"}

\item{printPlot}{logical. print a plot of the true population trajectory?}

\item{collarNumYears}{integer. Number of years until collar falls off}

\item{collarOffTime}{integer. Month that collars fall off. A number from 1
(January) to 12 (December)}

\item{collarOnTime}{integer. Month that collars are deployed. A number from 1
(January) to 12 (December)}

\item{distScen}{data.frame. Disturbance scenario. Must have columns "Year",
"Anthro", and "fire_excl_anthro" containing the year, percentage of the
landscape covered by anthropogenic disturbance buffered by 500 m, and the
percentage covered by fire that does not overlap anthropogenic disturbance.
See \code{\link[=disturbanceMetrics]{disturbanceMetrics()}}. If NULL the disturbance scenario is simulated
based on \code{cs}}

\item{populationGrowthTable}{data.frame. By default
\code{\link{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC}} is used. A custom table of model
parameters can be provided but it must match the column names of
\code{\link{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC}}.}

\item{survivalModelNumber, recruitmentModelNumber}{character. Which model
number to use see \code{\link{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC}} for options.}

\item{writeFilesDir}{characater. If not NULL \code{simSurvObs} and \code{ageRatioOut}
results will be saved to csv files in the directory provided}
}
\value{
a list with elements:
\itemize{
\item minYr: first year in the simulations,
\item maxYr: last year in the simulations,
\item simDisturbance: a data frame with columns Anthro, fire_excl_anthro, Total_dist, and  Year,
\item simSurvObs: a data frame of survival data with columns id, Year, event, enter, and exit,
\item ageRatioOut: a data frame of calf cow counts for each year with columns Year, Count, and Class,
\item exData: a tibble of expected population metric based on the national model,
\item cs: a data frame recording the input parameters for the simulation.
}
}
\description{
Simulate caribou survival data. First a true population trajectory is
simulated following the national model and a disturbance scenario. Then
realistic observations are simulated from this true population based on a
collaring program with the given parameters.

\title{Calculate resource selection probability}
\usage{
calcRSP(resourceProp, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{resourceProp}{A dataframe containing the proportions/densities of each
resource in the polygon and identifying the range.}

\item{coefs}{A dataframe containing coefficients for each season resource.}

\item{seasons}{A character vector containing "all" (default) or any of
"Spring", "Summer", "Fall", "Winter".}

\item{polygonIdCol}{A character vector giving the name of the column with a
unique identifier for each polygon or an integer indicating its position.
By default the first column is assumed to be the polygon id.}
}
\value{
Returns a dataframe with polygon ID, and probability of use for each
   season.
}
\description{
Calculate the resource selection probability for northern Ontario caribou in
 each season and range based on Hornseth and Rempel 2016.
}
\details{
This function takes a dataframe that identifies the range and the
 proportions of resource types and density of linear features for each
 polygon. A dataframe with coefficents must also be provided. The names of
 columns in the \code{resourceProp} and \code{coefs} dataframes must match
 those expected. The following table explains the meaning of the resource
 type codes.

\arguments{
\item{ranges}{Raster* or SpatialPolygon*. Range IDs. NA values will be excluded from analysis.}

\item{fires}{Raster*, SpatialPolygon*, or NULL. One or more maps indicating fire disturbance (T,F, or NA). If names cannot be interpreted as integers assume an ordered time-series. For rasters, NA and 0 areas will both be interpreted as no disturbance. Areas to be omitted from analysis (e.g. reservoirs) should be omitted from the range map.}

\item{anthroPoly}{Raster*, SpatialPolygon*, or NULL. One or more maps indicating polygonal anthropogenic disturbance (T,F, or NA). If names cannot be interpreted as integers assume an ordered time-series. See "tag" parameter for more details. For rasters, NA and 0 areas will both be interpreted as no disturbance. Areas to be omitted from analysis (e.g. reservoirs) should be omitted from the range map.}

\item{linear}{SpatialLines*, Raster* or NULL. One or more linear disturbance maps. If names cannot be interpreted as integers assume an ordered time-series. See "tag" parameter for more details. Areas to be omitted from analysis (e.g. reservoirs) should be omitted from the range map.}

\item{newLandings}{SpatialPoint*, SpatialPolygon*, Raster* or NULL. One or more maps of new features to be connected to the road network. If names cannot be interpreted as integers assume an ordered time-series. See "tag" parameter for more details.}

\item{tag}{Character string or list of these. The part of names(fires) and names(anthroPoly) that is not the year. For example, if names(fires)=c("y3","y4") and names(anthroPoly)=c("t3","t4"), set tag=list(fires="y",anthroPoly="t").}

\item{forceRaster}{Boolean. Default F. If TRUE input maps will be converted to rasters alligned with ranges input map.}
}
\value{
A validated LandscapeStateBCaribou object, containing alligned maps that are correctly named.
}
\description{
Landscape state for boreal caribou.
Returns a LandscapeStateBCaribou object containing correctly named and alligned maps for use by bCaribouMetaAnalysisPredictors().
}
\details{
All input maps must be alligned.
For raster fires and anthroPoly layers: NA and 0 areas will both be interpreted as no disturbance. Areas to be omitted from analysis (e.g. reservoirs) should be noted as NA in the range map. All non 0/NA values will be interpreted as disturbed (TRUE).
For ranges, fires, anthroPoly, and linear: if a single map is given, and names() cannot be interpreted as integers, will assume the feature is static over time.

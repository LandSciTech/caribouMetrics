\title{Update an existing DisturbanceMetrics Object}
\usage{
updateDisturbance(distMet, newData, linBuffMethod = "raster", isPercent = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{distMet}{DisturbanceMetrics object}

\item{newData}{named list of objects to be used to update distMet.
Potential names are: natDist, anthroDist, and linFeat.}

\item{linBuffMethod}{character. The method used to buffer linear features if
they are supplied as sf lines. The default is "raster" in which case they
are rasterized using the stars package and buffered using a moving window
method. If "sf" then the lines are buffered with st_buffer and then
rasterized. Either way points are included in the raster output.}

\item{isPercent}{logical. Should the results be returned as a percentage?}
}
\value{
A DisturbanceMetrics Object see \code{\link{DisturbanceMetrics-class}}
}
\description{
Update a DisturbanceMetrics object in order to avoid reprocessing parts of
the data that have not changed. New data is supplied as a named list and the
object is updated depending on the elements provided in the list.
}
\details{
If \code{newData} contains only linFeat or anthroDist then the new data will
be combined with the existing data in the DisturbanceMetrics object to
determine the buffered anthropogenic disturbance

If  \code{newData} contains only natDist then only Fire is updated.

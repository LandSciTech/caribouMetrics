\arguments{
\item{N0}{Number or vector of numbers. Initial population size for one or
more sample populations.}

\item{numSteps}{Number. Number of years to project.}

\item{R_bar}{Number or vector of numbers. Expected recruitment rate (calf:cow
ratio) for one or more sample populations.}

\item{S_bar}{Number or vector of numbers. Expected adult female survival for
one or more sample populations.}

\item{P_0}{Number. Maximum recruitment multiplier.}

\item{P_K}{Number. Recruitment multiplier at carrying capacity.}

\item{a}{Number. Density dependence shape parameter.}

\item{b}{Number. Allee effect parameter.}

\item{K}{Number. Carrying capacity multiplier.}

\item{h_S}{Number. Maximum survival.}

\item{interannualVar}{list or logical. List containing interannual
variability parameters. These can be either coefficients of variation
(R_CV, S_CV) or beta precision parameters (R_phi, S_phi). Set to \code{FALSE}
ignore interannual variability.}

\item{probOption}{Character. Choices are "binomial","continuous" or
"matchJohnson2020". See description for details.}

\item{adjustR}{Logical. Adjust R to account for delayed age at first
reproduction (DeCesare et al. 2012; Eacker et al. 2019).}

\item{progress}{Logical. Should progress updates be shown?}

\value{

projections for each sample population.

\description{
Estimate population growth given estimated demographic rates based on the
amount of disturbance in the landscape. This is accomplished with an
implementation of the 2-stage population growth model used in Johnson et al.
(2020) but with some differences described in Dyson et al. (2022). Given
default parameter values, this is an implementation of the 2-stage population
growth model described in Dyson et al. (in Prep). Set \code{probOption = "matchJohnson2020"} to reproduce the model used in Johnson et al. 2020. Set
\code{probOption = "continuous"}, \code{interannualVar = FALSE}, and \code{K = FALSE} to
reproduce the simpler 2-stage demographic model without interannual
variability, density dependence, or discrete numbers of animals used by
Stewart et al. (in prep). See \code{vignette("caribouDemography")} for additional
details and examples.
}
\details{
The number of post-juvenile females that survive from year \eqn{t} to the
next year \eqn{W_t} is binomially distributed with survival probability
\eqn{S_t}: \eqn{W_{t} \sim \text{Binomial}(N_t,S_t)}. The number of juveniles
recruiting to the post-juvenile class is a Poisson distributed function of
the number of surviving post-juvenile females and the adjusted recruitment
rate \eqn{X_t}: \eqn{J_{t} \sim \text{Poisson}(X_t, W_t)}. The post-juvenile
female population in the next year includes both survivors and new recruits:
\eqn{N_{t+1}=W_t+J_t}. Annual population growth rate \eqn{\lambda_t} is set
to 0 when \eqn{N_t} is 0, and is otherwise \eqn{\lambda_t=N_{t+1}/N_t}.

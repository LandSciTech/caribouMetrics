\title{Get a set of simulation results from the national model}
\usage{
getSimsNational(
  replicates = 1000,
  N0 = 1000,
  Anthro = seq(0, 100, by = 1),
  fire_excl_anthro = 0,
  useQuantiles = NULL,
  populationGrowthTable = NULL,
  adjustR = F,
  forceUpdate = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{N0}{initial population size}

\item{Anthro, fire_excl_anthro}{numeric. A vector of numbers between 0 and 100
representing the percentage of the landscape covered by anthropogenic
disturbance buffered by 500 m, and the percentage covered by fire that does
not overlap anthropogenic disturbance. The two vectors will be combined
with \code{expand.grid()} to give the set of scenarios simulated.}

\item{forceUpdate}{logical. If the default inputs are used the result is
cached. Set \code{forceUpdate} to TRUE to ensure the simulations are re-run.}
}
\value{
a list with two elements:
\itemize{
\item summary: a tibble with a summary of parameter values for each scenario.
Column names are Anthro, Mean, lower, upper, Parameter.
\item samples: a tibble with parameter values for each scenario and replicate
4 rows per replicate \* scenario. Column names are Anthro, Parameter and Value

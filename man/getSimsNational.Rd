\title{Get a set of simulation results from the national model}
\usage{
getSimsNational(
  replicates = 1000,
  N0 = 1000,
  Anthro = seq(0, 100, by = 1),
  fire_excl_anthro = 0,
  useQuantiles = NULL,
  populationGrowthTable = NULL,
  adjustR = F,
  forceUpdate = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{replicates}{integer. Number of replicate populations.}

\item{N0}{initial population size}

\item{Anthro, fire_excl_anthro}{numeric. A vector of numbers between 0 and 100
representing the percentage of the landscape covered by anthropogenic
disturbance buffered by 500 m, and the percentage covered by fire that does
not overlap anthropogenic disturbance. The two vectors will be combined
with \code{expand.grid()} to give the set of scenarios simulated.}

\item{useQuantiles}{logical or numeric. If it is a numeric
vector it must be length 2 and give the low and high limits of the
quantiles to use. If \code{useQuantiles != FALSE}, each replicate population is
assigned to a quantile of the distribution of variation around the expected
values, and remains in that quantile as covariates change.
If \code{useQuantiles = TRUE}, replicate populations
will be assigned to quantiles in the default range of 0.025 and 0.975.}

\item{populationGrowthTable}{data.frame. By default
\code{\link{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC}} is used. A custom table of model
parameters can be provided but it must match the column names of
\code{\link{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC}}.}

\item{adjustR}{Logical. Adjust R to account for delayed age at first reproduction (DeCesare et al. 2012; Eacker et al. 2019).}

\item{forceUpdate}{logical. If the default inputs are used the result is
cached. Set \code{forceUpdate} to TRUE to ensure the simulations are re-run.}
}
\value{
a list with two elements:
\itemize{
\item summary: a tibble with a summary of parameter values for each scenario.
Column names are Anthro, Mean, lower, upper, Parameter.
\item samples: a tibble with parameter values for each scenario and replicate
4 rows per replicate \* scenario. Column names are Anthro, Parameter and Value

\description{
When composition surveys are conducted there is a possibility of bias in calf
cow ratios due to misidentifying young bulls as adult females and vice versa
or missing calves.

\section{Model of bias in recruitment estimates from calf:cow surveys}{
We assume each group of animals in a calf:cow composition survey contains one
or more collared adult females (\eqn{T}), and may also include: uncollared adult
females misidentified as young bulls or unknown sex (\eqn{U}); correctly
identified uncollared adult females (\eqn{V}); young bulls correctly identified
as male or unknown sex (\eqn{O}); young bulls misidentified as uncollared adult
females (\eqn{P}); observed calves (\eqn{J}); and unobserved calves (\eqn{K}). The
apparent number of adult females in the group is \eqn{T+V+P=Tw}, where \eqn{w} is a
multiplier that defines the apparent number of adult females as a function of
the number of collared animals. The ratio of young bulls to uncollared adult
females in the group is: \deqn{q = \frac{P+O}{U+V}}. Assuming an equal
probability \eqn{u} of misidentifying young bulls as adult females and vice
versa, we get \eqn{V=(U+V)(1-u)} and \eqn{P=(O+P)u}. Given a probability \eqn{z} of
missing calves, we get \eqn{J=(J+K)(1-z)}.

Our objective is to model the sex and bias-corrected recruitment rate
\eqn{X=\frac{J+K}{2(T+U+V)}} as a function of the observed calf:cow ratio
\eqn{R=J/(T+V+P)}, the cow multiplier \eqn{w}, the ratio of young bulls to adult
females \eqn{q}, and the misidentification probabilities \eqn{u} and \eqn{z}. We start by
solving for \eqn{T+U+V} as a function of \eqn{q,w,u} and \eqn{T}. Recognize that
\eqn{P=Tw-T-V}, \eqn{U+V=V/(1-u)}, and \eqn{P+O=P/u} to write \eqn{q} as
\deqn{q=\frac{Tw-T-V}{uV/(1-u)}.} Rearrange to get
\deqn{V=\frac{T(w-1)(1-u)}{qu+1-u}.} Recognize that \eqn{U=Vu/(1-u)} to write
\eqn{T+U+V} as a function of \eqn{q,w,u} and \eqn{T}: \deqn{T+U+V=T\frac{qu+w-u}{qu+1-u}.}
Recognize that the number of observed calves \eqn{J} is the product of the
apparent recruitment rate and the apparent number of adult females \eqn{J=RTw},
and that therefore \eqn{J+K=RTw/(1-z)} to rewrite the bias corrected recruitment
rate \eqn{X=\frac{J+K}{2(T+U+V)}} as a function of \eqn{w,u,z} and \eqn{R}:
\deqn{X=R\frac{w(1+qu-u)}{2(w+qu-u)(1-z)}.} For simplicity, we write \eqn{X} as a
function of a bias correction term \eqn{c}: \deqn{c=\frac{w(1+qu-u)}{(w+qu-u)(1-z)};
X=cR/2.}
If we also adjust for delayed age at first reproduction (DeCesare et al.
2012; Eacker et al. 2019), the adjusted recruitment rate becomes
\deqn{X=\frac{cR/2}{1+cR/2}.}

Uncertainty about the value of the bias correction term \eqn{c} can be
approximated with a Log-normal distribution. Given the apparent number of
adult females per collared animal \eqn{w} the mean and standard deviation of
\eqn{\log{c}} can be calculated for samples from the expected range of values
of \eqn{q}, \eqn{u} and \eqn{z}.

\usage{
disturbanceMetrics(
  natDist,
  anthroDist,
  harv,
  linFeat,
  projectPoly,
  caribouRange,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{natDist}{filename or RasterLayer. Presence or absence of natural
disturbance, primarily by fire.}

\item{anthroDist}{filename or RasterLayer. Anthropogenic disturbance other
than harvest. This can have an effect on any type of landcover except water.}

\item{harv}{filename or RasterLayer. Harvest history. This can only have an
effect on forest landcover types and will not affect wetlands or water.}

\item{linFeat}{filename, sf object or named list with elements
roads, rail, and utilities. Linear features.}

\item{projectPoly}{filename or sf object. Polygon defining the project area.}

\item{caribouRange}{character. The range where caribou were located. See
\code{unique(coefTableHR$Range)} for options.}

\item{padProjPoly}{logical. Should the area around the \code{projectPoly} be
used to avoid edge effects? If FALSE, the default, only data from inside the
\code{projectPoly} is used. If TRUE then \code{projectPoly} is buffered and
the other variables are clipped to the extent of the buffered area. Results
are always clipped to the original \code{projectPoly}. It is ideal to set
this to TRUE and provide a dataset that is larger than the
\code{projectPoly} to avoid edge effects.}

\item{padFocal}{logical. This value is passed to the pad argument in
\code{raster::focal}, if it is FALSE then cells near the edge will return
NA, if it is TRUE a value will be returned for each cell that assumes cells
outside the input data are 0 for all resource types. This is not a good
assumption and should be used with caution.}

\item{bufferWidth}{number. Width of buffer applied to anthropogenic disturbance in metres. Default is 500.}

\description{
Calculate the predictors described in Table 52 of Environment Canada (2011) Scientific Assessment to Inform the Identification of Critical Habitat for Woodland Caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), Boreal Population, in Canada:2011 Update. Ottawa, Ontario.
So far, the variables calculated by this function include:
\itemize{
  \item fire: % fire
  \item anthro: % non-overlapping anthropogenic disturbance. 
  \item totalDist: Percent total non-overlapping fire and anthropogenic disturbance.
}
}
\details{
Note that NA values are omitted from tabulated area.
Missing layers are omitted from the output, not interpreted as 0 disturbance.

 returned and \code{\link{updateDisturbance}} for updating and existing
 DisturbanceMetrics object.

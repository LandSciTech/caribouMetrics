\usage{
disturbanceMetrics(landCover, linFeat, projectPoly, is.percent = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{landCover}{filename or RasterLayer. 0 and NA values are assumed to be
water and omitted from the tabulated area. Note landCover is also used to
define the input grid, so must be provided even if all values are 1.}

\item{linFeat}{filename, RasterLayer, sf object or a list of these that will
be combined. Linear features.}

\item{projectPoly}{filename or sf object. Polygons defining range boundaries.}

\item{natDist}{filename or RasterLayer. Presence or absence of natural
disturbance, primarily by fire. Should include 40 years cumulative
disturbance. Optional.}

\item{anthroDist}{filename or RasterLayer. Anthropogenic disturbance including
harvest. This can have an effect on any type of landcover except water.
Should include 40 years cumulative disturbance. Optional.}

\item{padProjPoly}{logical. Should the area around the \code{projectPoly} be
used to avoid edge effects? If FALSE, the default, only data from inside the
\code{projectPoly} is used. If TRUE then \code{projectPoly} is buffered and
the other variables are clipped to the extent of the buffered area. Results
are always clipped to the original \code{projectPoly}. It is ideal to set
this to TRUE and provide a dataset that is larger than the
\code{projectPoly} to avoid edge effects.}

\item{padFocal}{logical. This value is passed to the pad argument in
\code{raster::focal}, if it is FALSE then cells near the edge will return
NA, if it is TRUE a value will be returned for each cell that assumes cells
outside the input data are 0 for all resource types. This is not a good
assumption and should be used with caution.}

\item{bufferWidth}{number. Width of buffer applied to anthropogenic
disturbance in metres. Default is 500.}

\description{
Calculate the predictors described in Table 52 of Environment Canada (2011)
Scientific Assessment to Inform the Identification of Critical Habitat for
Woodland Caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), Boreal Population, in
Canada:2011 Update. Ottawa, Ontario. So far, the variables calculated by this
function include: \itemize{ \item fire: % fire \item anthro: % non-overlapping
anthropogenic disturbance. \item totalDist: Percent total non-overlapping fire
and anthropogenic disturbance. }
}
\details{
Note assume natDist and anthroDist include 40 years of cumulative disturbance.
Note that locations where landCover is NA or 0 are omitted from the tabulated
area. Missing layers are omitted from the output, not interpreted as 0
disturbance. To update an existing CaribouHabitat object with new data see
\link[caribouMetrics]{updateDisturbance}.

\usage{
demographicRates(
  covTable,
  popGrowthPars,
  ignorePrecision = FALSE,
  returnSample = FALSE,
  useQuantiles = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{covTable}{data.frame. A table of covariate values to be used. Column
names must match the coefficient names in \code{\link{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC}}. 
Each row is a different scenario.}

\item{popGrowthPars}{list. Coefficient values returned by
\code{demographicCoefficients}}

\item{ignorePrecision}{logical. Should the precision of the model be used if
it is available? When precision is used variance among populations around the
National mean responses is considered in addition to the uncertainty about 
the coefficient estimates.}

\item{returnSample}{logical. If TRUE the returned data.frame has replicates *
scenarios rows. If FALSE the returned data.frame has one row per scenario
and additional columns summarizing the variation among replicates. See
Value for details.}

\item{useQuantiles}{logical or numeric. If it is a numeric
vector it must be length 2 and give the low and high limits of the
quantiles to use. Only relevant when \code{ignorePrecision = FALSE} and
\code{returnSample = TRUE}. If \code{useQuantiles = TRUE}, each replicate population is
assigned to a quantile of the distribution of variation around the expected
values, and remains in that quantile as covariates change. If
\code{useQuantiles = FALSE}, sampling is done independently for each combination of
scenario and replicate, so the value for a particular replicate population
in one scenario is unrelated to the values for that replicate in other
scenarios. If interested in projecting impacts of changing disturbance on
the trajectories of replicate populations set \code{useQuantiles = TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A data.frame of predictions. The data.frame includes all columns in
  \code{covTable} with additional columns depending on \code{returnSample}.
  
  If \code{returnSample = FALSE} the number of rows is the same as the 
  number of rows in \code{covTable}, additional columns are:
  \describe{
    \item{"S_bar" and "R_bar"}{The mean estimated values of survival and 
      recruitment (calves per cow)}
    \item{"S_stdErr" and "R_stdErr"}{Standard error of the estimated values}
    \item{"S_PIlow"/"S_PIhigh" and "R_PIlow"/"R_PIhigh"}{95\% Prediction 
      interval for estimated values}
  } 
  If \code{returnSample = TRUE} the number of rows is \code{nrow(covTable) *
   replicates} additional columns are:
  \describe{
    \item{"scnID"}{A unique identifier for scenarios provided in
       \code{covTable}}
    \item{"replicate"}{A replicate identifier, unique within each scenario}
    \item{"S_bar" and "R_bar"}{The expected values of survival and 
      recruitment (calves per cow)}
  }
}
\description{
A wrapper around \code{\link{sampleRates}} to sample 
survival and recruitment rates.

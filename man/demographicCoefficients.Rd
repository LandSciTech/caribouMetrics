\title{Sample demographic regression model coefficients}
\usage{
demographicCoefficients(
  replicates,
  modelVersion = "Johnson",
  survivalModelNumber = "M1",
  recruitmentModelNumber = "M4",
  useQuantiles = TRUE,
  populationGrowthTable = popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC
)

getCoefs(populationGrowthTable, resVar, modelVersion, modNum)

sampleCoefs(coefTable, replicates)
}
\arguments{
\item{replicates}{integer. Number of replicate populations.}

\item{modelVersion}{character. Which model version to use. Currently the only
option is "Johnson" for the model used in Johnson et. al. (2020), but
additional options may be added in the future.}

\item{survivalModelNumber, recruitmentModelNumber}{character. Which model
number to use see \link{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC} for options.}

\item{useQuantiles}{logical or numeric. If it is a numeric vector it must be
length 2 and give the low and high limits of the quantiles to use. If
\code{useQuantiles != FALSE}, each replicate population is assigned to a
quantile of the distribution of variation around the expected values, and
remains in that quantile as covariates change. If \code{useQuantiles = TRUE},
replicate populations will be assigned to quantiles in the default range of
0.025 and 0.975.}

\item{populationGrowthTable}{data.frame.\link{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC} is
included in the package and should be used in most cases. A custom table of
model coefficients and standard errors or confidence intervals can be
provided but it must match the column names of \link{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC}.
If the table does not contain the standard error it is calculated from the
confidence interval.}

\item{resVar}{character. Response variable, typically "femaleSurvival" or
"recruitment"}

\item{modNum}{character vector. Which model number(s) to use see
\link{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC} for typical options.}

\item{coefTable}{data.table. Table must have columns "Coefficient" for the
name of the coefficient, "Value" for the value of the coefficient and
"StdErr" for the standard error of coefficients. Typically created with
\code{\link[=getCoefs]{getCoefs()}}}
}
\value{
For \code{demographicCoefficients} a list with elements:
\itemize{
\item "modelVersion": The name of the model version
\item "coefSamples_Survival" and"coefSamples_Recruitment":
lists with elements:
\itemize{
\item "coefSamples": Bootstrapped coefficients with \code{replicates} rows
\item "coefValues": Coefficient values taken from \code{populationGrowthTable}
\item "quantiles": A vector of randomly selected quantiles between 0.025 and
0.975 with length \code{replicates}
}
}

For \code{getCoefs}: a named list with one element per model version. The names are
\code{modelVersion_modNum_Type}. Each element contains a data.frame that is a subset
of \code{populationGrowthTable} for the selected model

For \code{sampleCoefs} a list with elements:
\itemize{
\item "coefSamples": Bootstrapped coefficients with \code{replicates} rows
\item "coefValues": Coefficient values taken from \code{populationGrowthTable}
}
}
\description{
Select the regression coefficient values and standard errors for the desired
model version (see \code{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC} for options) and then sample
from the Gaussian distribution for each replicate population.
\code{demographicCoefficients} is a wrapper around \code{\link[=getCoefs]{getCoefs()}}, which selects
coefficients and \code{\link[=sampleCoefs]{sampleCoefs()}}, which samples coefficients, for both the
survival and recruitment models.

Sample coefficient values from the normal distribution based on the
coefficient and standard error
}
\details{
Each population is optionally assigned to quantiles of the error
distributions for survival and recruitment. Using quantiles means that the
population will stay in these quantiles as disturbance changes over time, so
there is persistent variation in recruitment and survival among example
populations.
}
\examples{
# sample coefficients for default models
demographicCoefficients(10)

# try a different model
demographicCoefficients(10, modelVersion = "Johnson", survivalModelNumber = "M1",
                        recruitmentModelNumber = "M3")

getCoefs(popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC, "femaleSurvival", "Johnson", "M1")

cfs <- getCoefs(popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC, "recruitment", "Johnson", "M3")

sampleCoefs(cfs[[1]], 10)

\usage{
demographicCoefficients(
  replicates,
  modelVersion = "Johnson",
  survivalModelNumber = "M1",
  recruitmentModelNumber = "M4",
  useQuantiles = TRUE,
  populationGrowthTable = popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC
)
}
\arguments{
\item{replicates}{integer. Number of replicate populations.}

\item{modelVersion}{character. Which model version to use. Currently the only
option is "Johnson" for the model used in Johnson et. al. (2020), but
additional options may be added in the future.}

\item{survivalModelNumber, recruitmentModelNumber}{character. Which model
number to use see \link{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC} for options.}

\item{useQuantiles}{logical or numeric. If it is a numeric vector it must be
length 2 and give the low and high limits of the quantiles to use. If
\code{useQuantiles != FALSE}, each replicate population is assigned to a
quantile of the distribution of variation around the expected values, and
remains in that quantile as covariates change. If \code{useQuantiles = TRUE},
replicate populations will be assigned to quantiles in the default range of
0.025 and 0.975.}

\item{populationGrowthTable}{data.frame. By default
\link{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC} is used. A custom table of model parameters
can be provided but it must match the column names of
\link{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC}.}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
\itemize{
\item "modelVersion": The name of the model version
\item "coefSamples_Survival" and"coefSamples_Recruitment":
lists with elements:
\itemize{
\item "coefSamples": Bootstrapped coefficients with \code{replicates} rows
\item "coefValues": Coefficient values taken from \code{populationGrowthTable}
\item "quantiles": A vector of randomly selected quantiles between 0.025 and
0.975 with length \code{replicates}
}
}
}
\description{
A wrapper around \code{\link[=getCoefs]{getCoefs()}} to select coefficients for the appropriate
model version and \code{\link[=sampleCoefs]{sampleCoefs()}} to sample coefficients for each replicate
population, for both the survival and recruitment models. Also optionally,
generates quantiles.
}
\examples{
# sample coefficients for default models
demographicCoefficients(10)

# try a different model
demographicCoefficients(10, modelVersion = "Johnson", survivalModelNumber = "M1",
                        recruitmentModelNumber = "M3")

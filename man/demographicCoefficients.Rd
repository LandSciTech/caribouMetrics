demographicCoefficients(
  replicates,
  modelVersion = "Johnson",
  survivalModelNumber = "M1",
  recruitmentModelNumber = "M4",
  randomQuantiles = TRUE,
  populationGrowthTable = popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC

}
\arguments{
\item{replicates}{integer. Number of replicate populations.}

\item{modelVersion}{character. Which model version to use. Options are "ECCC"
for the model used in the ECCC Report (2011) and "Johnson" for the model
used in Johnson et. al. (2020)}

\item{survivalModelNumber, recruitmentModelNumber}{character. Which model
number to use see \code{populationGrowthTable} for options.}

\item{randomQuantiles}{logical. Should each replicate population be assigned a random quantile to be used for
sampling the from the distribution of demographic parameters around the means?}

\item{populationGrowthTable}{data.frame. By default
\code{populationGrowthTable} is used. A custom table of model parameters
can be provided but it must match the column names of
\code{populationGrowthTable}.}
}
\value{
A list with elements:
\describe{
    \item{"modelVersion"}{The name of the model version}
    \item{"coeffTable_Survival" and "coeffTable_Recruitment"}{
      lists with elements:
       \describe{
          \item{"coeffTable"}{Bootstrapped coefficients with \code{replicates} 
            rows}
          \item{"coeffValues"}{Coefficient values taken from 
            \code{populationGrowthTable}}
          \item{"quantiles"}{A vector of randomly selected quantiles between
             0.025 and 0.975 with length \code{replicates}}
        }
      }
  }
}
\description{
A wrapper around \code{\link{makePopDT}} to select coefficients for the
appropriate model version and \code{\link{buildCoefTable}} to sample
coefficients for each replicate population, for both the survival and 
recruitment models. Also optionally, generates quantiles with
\code{\link{getQuantiles}}.

\title{Generate default population growth model predictions}
\usage{
calcDemoPredictions(
  covTable,
  popGrowthPars,
  ignorePrecision = TRUE,
  returnSample = FALSE,
  useQuantiles = FALSE,
  interannualVar = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{covTable}{data.frame. A table of covariate values to be used in
predictions. Column names must match the coefficient names in
\code{popGrowthTableJohnson}. Each row is a different scenario.}

\item{popGrowthPars}{list. The result of \code{calcDemoParams}}

\item{ignorePrecision}{logical. Should the precision of the model be used if
it is available? When precision is used the variance of each population
around the National mean response is considered in addition to the
uncertainty in the coefficient estimates.}

\item{returnSample}{logical. If TRUE the returned data.frame has replicates *
scenarios rows. If FALSE the returned data.frame has one row per scenario
and additional columns summarizing the variation among replicates. See
Value for details.}

\item{useQuantiles}{logical. Should the sampling around the National mean use
quantiles or random sampling?}

\item{interannualVar}{logical or a list with names "S" and "Rec". Should the
interannual variation in population growth be considered? If TRUE a sample
is taken from the beta distribution with precision 5.06 for the recruitment
model and 16.49 for the survival model. If a list the values in "S" and
"Rec" are used for the precision for survival and recruitment,
respectively.}
}
\value{
A data.frame of predictions. The data.frame includes all columns in
  \code{covTable} with additional columns depending on \code{returnSample}.
  
  If \code{returnSample = FALSE} the number of rows is the same as the 
  number of rows in \code{covTable}, additional columns are:
  \describe{
    \item{"S_bar" and "R_bar"}{The mean estimated values of survival and 
      recruitment (calves per cow)}
    \item{"S_stdErr" and "R_stdErr"}{Standard error of the estimated values}
    \item{"S_PIlow"/"S_PIhigh" and "R_PIlow"/"R_PIhigh"}{95% Prediction 
      interval for estimated values}
  } 
  If \code{returnSample = TRUE} the number of rows is \code{nrow(covTable) *
   replicates} additional columns are:
  \describe{
    \item{"scnID"}{A unique identifier for scenarios provided in
       \code{covTable}}
    \item{"replicate"}{A replicate identifier, unique within each scenario}
    \item{"S_bar" and "R_bar"}{The estimated values of survival and 
      recruitment (calves per cow)}
  }
}
\description{
A wrapper around \code{\link{generatePopGrowthPredictions}} to generate the 
population growth model predictions for both survival and recruitment under
default conditions that match those needed by most users.

\arguments{
\item{survData}{either a path to a csv file or a dataframe containing the
columns "Year", "event", "enter" and "exit". Enter and exit are the
beginning and end of the time interval and should be a number from 1 to 12
(December) or 0. Event is 0 or 1 where 0 means the animal lived and 1 died.
See \code{\link[survival:Surv]{survival::Surv()}} for more details.}

\item{ageRatio}{either a path to a csv file or a dataframe containing
the columns "Year","Count", and "Class". Where class can be either calf or
cow}

\item{disturbance}{either a path to a csv file or a dataframe containing the
columns "Anthro","fire_excl_anthro", and "Year"}

\item{betaPriors}{a list of model priors see \code{\link[=getPriors]{getPriors()}}}

\item{startYear, endYear}{year defining the beginning of the observation
period and the end of the projection period.}

\item{Nchains}{Number of chains for the Bayesian model}

\item{Niter}{Number of iterations for the Bayesian model}

\item{Nburn}{Length of burn-in for the Bayesian model}

\item{Nthin}{Thinning rate for the Bayesian model}

\item{N0}{Initial population size}

\item{survAnalysisMethod}{Survival analysis method either "KaplanMeier" or
"Exponential". Exponential is only recommended for small sample sizes}

\item{adjustR}{Logical. Adjust R to account for delayed age at first reproduction (DeCesare et al. 2012; Eacker et al. 2019).}

\item{assessmentYrs}{Number of years over which to assess lambda (growth rate)}

\item{inputList}{an optional list of inputs with names matching the above, if
an argument is included in this list it will override the named argument}

\item{saveJAGStxt}{file path. Directory where the JAGS model txt files will
be saved. Default is \code{tempdir()}}

\item{quiet}{logical. Should jags be run quietly?}
}
\value{
a list with elements:
\itemize{
\item result: an \code{rjags} model object see \code{\link[R2jags:jags]{R2jags::jags()}}.
\item survInput: a data.frame with the input data used in the model.

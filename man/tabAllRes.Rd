\title{Tabulate results from caribou Bayesian IPM}
\usage{
tabAllRes(rrSurvMod, startYear, endYear, doSummary = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{rrSurvMod}{rjags model object. Produced by
\link{caribouBayesianIPM()$result}}

\item{startYear}{integer. Start year of the simulation}

\item{endYear}{integer. Start year of the simulation}

\item{doSummary}{logical. Should the results be summarized by year (TRUE) or
should results of each run be returned individually?}
}
\value{
a data.frame. If \code{doSummary = TRUE} this will contain the mean,
standard deviation and upper and lower credible intervals for all
parameters and years. There is also a probability that the population is
viable calculated as the proportion of runs where the population growth
rate was greater than 0.99. If \code{doSummary = FALSE} then the data.frame
contains a row for every simulation run and parameter.

\description{
Create a summary table for each population parameter modelled by
\code{\link[=caribouBayesianIPM]{caribouBayesianIPM()}}

\arguments{
\item{modList}{a named list of modifiers to use to change the priors. If a
modifier is supplied here the corresponding argument below is ignored.}

\item{survivalModelNumber, recruitmentModelNumber}{character. Which model
number to use see \link{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC} for options.}

\item{rAnthroSlopeSE}{Standard deviation of effect of disturbance on recruitment.}

\item{rFireSlopeSE}{Standard deviation of effect of fire on recruitment.}

\item{sAnthroSlopeSE}{Standard deviation of effect of disturbance on survival.}

\item{sIntSE}{Standard deviation of survival intercept.}

\item{sNuMin, sNuMax}{Uniform prior for coefficient of variation among years.}

\item{rIntSE}{Standard deviation of recruitment intercept.}

\item{rNuMin, rNuMax}{Uniform prior for coefficient of variation among years.}

\item{qMin}{number in 0, 1. Minimum ratio of bulls to cows in composition
survey groups.}

\item{qMax}{number in 0, 1. Maximum ratio of bulls to cows in composition
survey groups.}

\item{uMin}{number in 0, 1. Minimum probability of misidentifying young bulls
as adult females and vice versa in composition survey.}

as adult females and vice versa in composition survey.}

\item{zMin}{number in 0, 1. Minimum probability of missing calves in
composition survey.}

\item{zMax}{number in 0, 1. Maximum probability of missing calves in
composition survey.}

\item{cowMult}{number. The apparent number of adult females per collared
animal in composition survey.}

\item{populationGrowthTable}{data.frame.\link{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC} is
included in the package and should be used in most cases. A custom table of
model coefficients and standard errors or confidence intervals can be
provided but it must match the column names of \link{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC}.
If the table does not contain the standard error it is calculated from the
confidence interval.}

\item{modelVersion}{character. Which model version to use. Currently the only
option is "Johnson" for the model used in Johnson et. al. (2020), but
additional options may be added in the future.}

\item{returnValues}{logical. Default is TRUE. If FALSE returns strings for
some values showing the initial values and the modifier ie "0.9 * 1.05"}

\description{
Returns prior parameter values for the Bayesian population model. The
starting point is estimated coefficients from national
demographic-disturbance relationships in the table
\code{popGrowthTableJohnsonECCC}.
}
\details{
Standard errors and random effects of year have
been calibrated so that the 95\% prior prediction intervals for survival and
recruitment from the Bayesian model match the range between the 2.5\% and
97.5\% quantiles of 1000 survival and recruitment trajectories from the
national demographic model \code{\link[=caribouPopGrowth]{caribouPopGrowth()}}. A prior for the
unknown composition survey bias correction term \code{c} is set by specifying an
apparent number of adult females per collared animal(\code{cowMult}) and minimum
and maximum values for each of the ratio of bulls to cows (\eqn{q}), the
probability of misidentifying young bulls as adult females and vice versa
(\eqn{u}), and the probability of missing calves (\eqn{z}) in composition
surveys. See \code{\link[=compositionBiasCorrection]{compositionBiasCorrection()}} and \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2025.103095}{Hughes et al. (2025)} for additional details.

\title{Category 2 thresholds table}
\format{A data frame with 48 rows and 6 variables: \describe{
  \item{Range}{the caribou range name} 
  \item{Season}{season, one of Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter}
  \item{Sensitivity}{the proportion of presences correctly predicted as presence}
  \item{Specificity}{the proportion of absences correctly predicted as absence} 
  \item{Threshold}{the value for the lowest probability of use that is considered 
  a predicted presence}
  \item{AUC}{the area under the resource operating characteristic (ROC) curve; 
  it ranges from 0-1 and indicates the overall success of the model for predicting
   both presence and absence} }}

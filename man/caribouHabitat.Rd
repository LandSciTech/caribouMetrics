\usage{
caribouHabitat(landCover, esker, linFeat, projectPoly, caribouRange, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{landCover}{filename or RasterLayer. Provincial landcover class}

\item{esker}{filename, RasterLayer or sf object. Eskers. If it is a
RasterLayer then it should be esker density in m^2/ha.}

\item{linFeat}{filename, RasterLayer, sf object or named list with elements
roads, rail, and utilities. Linear features. If it is a RasterLayer then it
should be linear feature density in m^2/ha.}

\item{projectPoly}{filename or sf object. Polygon defining the project area.}

\item{caribouRange}{character. The range where caribou were located. See
\code{unique(coefTableHR$Range)} for options.}

\item{updatedLC}{filename or RasterLayer. Land cover data used to update the
landCover raster in areas that were disturbed since the landCover data was
created. If NULL, the default the landCover will not be updated}

\item{age}{filename or RasterLayer. Tree age in years. Used to inform whether
a cell should be updated after disturbance}

\item{natDist}{filename or RasterLayer. Presence or absence of natural
disturbance, primarily by fire.}

\item{anthroDist}{filename or RasterLayer. Anthropogenic disturbance other
than harvest. This can have an effect on any type of landcover except water.}

\item{harv}{filename or RasterLayer. Harvest history. This can only have an
effect on forest landcover types and will not affect wetlands or water.}

\item{eskerSave}{filename to save rasterized esker data.}

\item{linFeatSave}{filename to save rasterized linear feature data.}

\item{padProjPoly}{logical. Should the area around the \code{projectPoly} be
used to avoid edge effects? If FALSE, the default, only data from inside the
\code{projectPoly} is used. If TRUE then \code{projectPoly} is buffered and
the other variables are clipped to the extent of the buffered area. Results
are always clipped to the original \code{projectPoly}. It is ideal to set
this to TRUE and provide a dataset that is larger than the
\code{projectPoly} to avoid edge effects.}

\item{padFocal}{logical. This value is passed to the pad argument in
\code{raster::focal}, if it is FALSE then cells near the edge will return
NA, if it is TRUE a value will be returned for each cell that assumes cells
outside the input data are 0 for all resource types. This is not a good
assumption and should be used with caution.}

\item{saveOutput}{character. The filename to save the rasterBrick of habitat
use probabilities to. Note this will overwrite any existing files.}

\description{
Calculate the probability of caribou habitat use in spring, summer, fall and
winter for caribou ranges in Northern Ontario, based on Hornseth and Rempel,
2016.
}
\details{
Caribou habitat use is calculated based on the availability of resources and
the presence of disturbances on the landscape. The primary source of resource
information is the \code{landCover} but this is can be updated based on more
recent \code{updatedLC} data and disturbance information. All data sources can
be provided either as filenames or as spatial files. The result is a
CaribouHabitat object which has methods defined for plotting and extracting
the results. To update an existing CaribouHabitat object with new data see
\link[caribouMetrics]{updateCaribou}.

\arguments{
\item{plc}{filename or RasterLayer. Provincial landcover class}

\item{esker}{filename, RasterLayer or sf object. Eskers. If it is a
RasterLayer then it should be esker density in m^2/ha.}

\item{fri}{filename or RasterLayer. Forest resource inventory class ids must
correspond to the ids in the \code{friLU}.}

\item{age}{filename or RasterLayer. Tree age in years}

\item{natDist}{filename or RasterLayer. Presence or absence or natural
disturbance, primarily by fire}

\item{anthroDist}{filename or RasterLayer. Anthropogenic disturbance}

\item{harv}{filename or RasterLayer. Harvest history}

\item{linFeat}{filename, RasterLayer, sf object or named list with elements
roads, rail, and utilities. Linear features. If it is a RasterLayer then it
should be linear feature density in m^2/ha}

\item{projectPoly}{filename or sf object. Polygon defining the project area}

\item{caribouRange}{character. The range where caribou were located. See
\code{unique(coefTableHR$Range)}}

\item{eskerSave}{filename to save rasterized esker data}

\item{linFeatSave}{filename to save rasterized linear feature data}

\item{padProjPoly}{logical. Should the area around the \code{projectPoly} be
used to avoid edge effects? If FALSE, the default, only data from inside the
\code{projectPoly} is used. If TRUE then \code{projectPoly} is buffered and
the other variables are clipped to the extent of the buffered area. Results
are always clipped to the original \code{projectPoly}.}

\item{friLU}{data.frame. A look up table to convert local forest units to
regional forest units. It should have two columns, the first must contain
all the unique values in the supplied \code{fri} raster and the second must
contain the names of regional forest units matching those provided in the
table \code{rfuToResType}}

\description{
Caluculate the probability of caribou habitat use in spring, summer, fall and
winter for caribou ranges in Northern Ontario, based on Hornseth and Rempel,
2016.
}
\details{
Caribou habitat use is calculated based on the availability of resources and
the presence of disturbances on the landscape. The primary source of resource
information is the \code{plc} but this is can be updated based on more recent
\code{fri} data and disturbance information. All data sources can be provided
either as filenames or as spatial files. The result is a CaribouHabitat object
which has methods defined for plotting and extracting the results. To update
an existing CaribouHabitat object with new data see \link[caribouMetrics]{updateCaribou}.

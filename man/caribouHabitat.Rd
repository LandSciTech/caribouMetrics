\usage{
caribouHabitat(landCover, esker, linFeat, projectPoly, caribouRange, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{landCover}{filename or RasterLayer. Provincial landcover class}

\item{esker}{filename, RasterLayer or sf object. Eskers. If it is a
RasterLayer then it should be esker density in m^2/ha.}

\item{linFeat}{filename, RasterLayer, sf object or named list with elements
roads, rail, and utilities. Linear features. If it is a RasterLayer then it
should be linear feature density in m^2/ha. If a RasterLayer is provided for
element roads then ptDensity will be used to assign a density of roads in
the pixel (default is 1).}

\item{projectPoly}{filename or sf object. Polygon defining the project area.
If caribouRange is a data.frame this must have a column called Range with
the name of the caribou range represented by the polygon which corresponds
to the Range column in the caribouRange data.frame}

\item{caribouRange}{character or data.frame. If character the range where
caribou were located. See \code{unique(coefTableHR$Range)} for options. If
data.frame it must have two columns Range and coefRange. Range is the name
of the geographical area and is used to link the table the the provided
\code{projectPoly} polygons. coefRange is the name of the caribou range that
the coefficients should be used from.}

\item{updatedLC}{filename or RasterLayer. Land cover data used to update the
landCover raster in areas that were disturbed since the landCover data was
created. If NULL, the default the landCover will not be updated}

\item{age}{filename or RasterLayer. Tree age in years. Used to inform whether
a cell should be updated after disturbance}

\item{natDist}{filename or RasterLayer. Presence or absence of natural
disturbance, primarily by fire.}

\item{anthroDist}{filename or RasterLayer. Anthropogenic disturbance other
than harvest. This can have an effect on any type of landcover except water.}

\item{harv}{filename or RasterLayer. Harvest history. This can only have an
effect on forest landcover types and will not affect wetlands or water.}

\item{eskerSave}{filename to save rasterized esker data.}

\item{linFeatSave}{filename to save rasterized linear feature data.}

\item{padProjPoly}{logical. Should the area around the \code{projectPoly} be
used to avoid edge effects? If FALSE, the default, only data from inside the
\code{projectPoly} is used. If TRUE then \code{projectPoly} is buffered and
the other variables are clipped to the extent of the buffered area. Results
are always clipped to the original \code{projectPoly}. It is ideal to set
this to TRUE and provide a dataset that is larger than the
\code{projectPoly} to avoid edge effects.}

\item{padFocal}{logical. This value is passed to the pad argument in
\code{raster::focal}, if it is FALSE then cells near the edge will return
NA, if it is TRUE a value will be returned for each cell that assumes cells
outside the input data are 0 for all resource types. This is not a good
assumption and should be used with caution.}

\item{saveOutput}{character. The filename to save the rasterBrick of habitat
use probabilities to. Note this will overwrite any existing files. The .grd
format is recommended because it will preserve layer names when the file is
reloaded.}

\item{winArea}{number. This is the area of the moving window that is used to
average proportions of each resource type at broader spatial scales. The
Hornseth and Rempel (2016) models used specific window areas which are
defined within this package and used as the default. You should only specify
a window size if you have good reason.}

\item{coefTable}{data.frame. Optional table of coefficients to be used in the
model. Must match the format and naming of \code{coefTableHR}}

\item{doScale}{logical. FALSE by default. Set to TRUE only if you have
supplied coefficients that were trained on standardized data which will
cause the input data to be scaled.}

\item{ptDensity}{number. Only used if road input is a raster. The density to
assign to points, in units of res(r). A value of 1 (the default) indicates
one straight line crossing of the pixel. A value of 2+2*2^0.5 is horizontal,
vertical, and diagonal crossings. If NULL, points in linObj will be ignored.}

\description{
Calculate the probability of caribou habitat use in spring, summer, fall and
winter for caribou ranges in Northern Ontario, based on Hornseth and Rempel,
2016.
}
\details{
Caribou habitat use is calculated based on the availability of resources and
the presence of disturbances on the landscape. The primary source of resource
information is the \code{landCover} but this is can be updated based on more
recent \code{updatedLC} data and disturbance information. All data sources can
be provided either as filenames or as spatial files. If filenames are provided
then the \code{landCover} is assumed to be the Provincial Landcover for
Ontario and the \code{updatedLC} is assumed to be the Forest Resource
Inventory and they are converted to resource types using \code{reclassPLC} and
\code{reclassFRI} respectively. The result is a CaribouHabitat object which
has methods defined for plotting and extracting the results. To update an
existing CaribouHabitat object with new data see
\link[caribouMetrics]{updateCaribou}.

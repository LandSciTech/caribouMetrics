\description{
This sets the proportion of forest resource types to 0 when there is more
than 35% disturbance in a 16ha area. Natural and anthropogenic disturbance
will affect all resource types except water (LGW) and natural disturbance
(DTN). Harvest disturbance will only affect forst resource types and in
addition to water and natural disturbance does not affect wetlands (ST, LGTP,
LGOP)
